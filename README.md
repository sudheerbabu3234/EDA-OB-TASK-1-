##  Project Overview

This project aims to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a retail sales dataset to uncover trends, patterns, and actionable insights that can support business decision-making. The dataset includes details such as date of sale, product category, customer ID, and sales amount. The EDA process includes data cleaning, descriptive statistics, time series analysis, and visualization.

##  Objectives

- Understand and clean the retail sales dataset
- Analyze sales trends over time using time series techniques
- Identify top-selling products and customer purchase behavior
- Visualize key metrics and trends using Python libraries
- Recommend business strategies based on insights

##  Tools & Technologies Used

- **Python**: Main programming language
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For code execution and analysis
- **Pandas & NumPy**: For data manipulation and numerical analysis
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For data visualization
- *(Optional)* **Power BI**: For building a dashboard (if applicable)

##  Steps Implemented

### 1. **Data Loading**
- Loaded the retail sales CSV file using `pandas`.
- Displayed first few rows to understand structure.

### 2. **Data Cleaning**
- Checked for null values, duplicates, and corrected data types.
- Filled or dropped missing values where necessary.
- Converted the `Date` column to datetime format and set it as index.

### 3. **Descriptive Statistics**
- Computed measures like mean, median, mode, standard deviation, etc.
- Summarized sales data using `.describe()` to identify outliers and trends.

### 4. **Time Series Analysis**
- Aggregated daily and monthly sales data.
- Plotted line graphs to visualize seasonal patterns and sales spikes.

### 5. **Customer & Product Analysis**
- Identified top-performing products based on total sales.
- Analyzed customer frequency and high-value buyers.

### 6. **Data Visualization**
- Created bar charts, line graphs, and heatmaps.
- Used `seaborn` to show relationships and distributions.
- Optionally exported summary data to Power BI for dashboarding.

### 7. **Insights & Recommendations**
- Suggested strategies such as:
  - Boosting inventory for top products
  - Running loyalty campaigns for repeat customers
  - Focusing marketing during high-sales periods
  - Reevaluating underperforming product categories
